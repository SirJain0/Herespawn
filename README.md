# Herespawn

## General Info

Herespawn is a simple mod that adds an extra button to the death screen, which allows you to conveniently respawn at the location which you died! This mod can come in handy when in the middle of an extensive boss fight and you need to quickly get back.

## More Details

Unfortunately, this mod is not supported in multiplayer. It is only guaranteed it works for single player. As well, please note that this mod, like my others, requires the Fabric API, and doesn't have a respective Forge port. Also, please remember that this mod is pretty much purely client side.
